About
--------------
A programming lab assignment, in one part, to focus on terminal I/O, conditional tests, state variables, mathematical expressions, loops, and methods. 


Extra
--------------
You can also read this file to learn more about 
	1. Markdown (used to generate this readme file),
	2. gitignore files (the .gitignore file might be hidden on your computer with your default settings due to the leading "."),
	3. classpath (also might be hidden, but you can inspect it to understand how containers can be added - such as our junit4 library's container)
	4. 

How to hand in assignment
-------------------------
When you are done, make sure to 
	1. save your work,
	2. stage the changed files,
	3. commit the changes to the local repo,
	4. push your changes to the remote repo,
	5. and submit the URL to the remote repo on Brightspace under the correct assignment to request grading.

Good luck, you'll do great!
